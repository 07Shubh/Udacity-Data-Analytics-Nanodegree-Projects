# Titanic shipwreck Exploration
By Shubh 
## Dataset
This exploration is based on Titanic dataset containing survival and other attributes of passengers travelling during the shipwreck, from https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data this dataset was divided into two parts training set and testing set for the purpose of machine learning analysis but in this project I will choose training set only for the purpose of explanatory analysis.

## Observations
<ul>
<li>In pclass 3, between age of 15-35, most of the passengers were male candidates.
<li>Number of passengers survived are less than the number of people died.So most of the passengers are likely to die.
<li>Passengers with Pclass 1 survived the most. So passengers with pclass 1 are less likey to die.
<li>Most of the passengers were travelling alone and more likely to die.
<li>50 % of passengers were in age group 21 to 38.
<li>Most of the passengers were male but most of the males did not survived. So male are less likely to survive.
<li>Female candidates who are older than 40 years, and belongs to pclass 3 are more likely to die.
</ul>


## Key Insights
<li>Males are less likely to survive.
<li>Passengers from high classes are more likely to survive.
<li>Passenger with pclass 3 are more likely to survive as compared to others.
<li>Most of the passengers are less likely to survive.
<li>Most of the passengers were adults.
